# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis – Project Overview

## Project Introduction  
Instacart, an online grocery service, seeks to optimize marketing and sales strategies through targeted campaigns. As a data analyst, I will analyse customer behavior and sales data to uncover insights on segmentation, peak shopping times, and popular products, informing strategic decisions for better customer targeting and product recommendations.

## Project Objectives  
Using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), this project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and addressing several business questions:
- Identifying peak days and times with the highest order frequency for optimal ad scheduling.
- Analysing customer spending patterns across different times of day.
- Grouping products by price ranges for more effective marketing strategies.
- Identifying the most popular product categories and departments.
- Segmenting customers based on loyalty, region, age, family status, and spending behavior.

The insights gained will help shape Instacart's marketing campaigns, improve product recommendations, and optimize sales strategies.

## Key Deliverables
- **Data Analysis & Insights**: Conducting detailed exploratory analysis to answer the key business questions and provide actionable insights.
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handling missing data, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Profiling customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior to inform targeted marketing strategies.
- **Visualisations & Reports**: Creating impactful visualisations and a final report with actionable business recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.

## Technical Skills & Learning Outcomes  
Through this project, I developed expertise in:
- ✅ Performing data wrangling, cleaning, and preparation.
- ✅ Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.
- ✅ Using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis and visualisation.
- ✅ Grouping and aggregating data to derive customer profiles and behavior patterns.
- ✅ Creating visualisations (bar charts, histograms, scatterplots) to communicate findings clearly.

This project highlights my ability to transform raw data into actionable business insights that drive strategic decisions.
